VisualMaker is the part of Wordy's code that combines several images into one mosaic. Use it to generate visuals for words whose Flickr search results aren't good enough and you found several better results on Google Images (or wherever).

To create a mosaic run VisualMaker and drag and drop all of the images at once. They will be deleted and the mosaic will be created in the same directory.
